  title:        "Figure of 8 orbit animation"
  description:  "Stepping using button will show a figure of 8 orbit animation on 7 segment display"
  how_it_works: "Signal goes through ring shift register, each flop in shift register is connected to a segment in the display."
  how_to_test:  "In button stepping mode, turn on switch 8 and press multiple times to fill figure of 8 with signal from switch 7, then toggle switch 7, step once, turn off switch 8, then keep stepping to see the orbit animation."
  external_hw:  "None"

  inputs:
    - clock
    - none
    - none
    - none
    - none
    - none
    - value of signal to enter into ring shift register when switch 8 is enabled
    - insert new signal from switch 7 into ring shift register
